//DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION using the SQL Server

Steps I took in cleasing th data.
		//Dim_Calender
For Dim calender I commented some queries out and pick the ones that was needed base on the  project I was to carry out. and I added some new lines of queries.

		//Dim_Customer  join with Geography
Dim_Customers I used case statement to replace the M with Male and F with Female and Gender as the heading.
To do some cleaning  I also used left join in the  customer city. 
I used Customer key to connect to the Fact table
The geography table will also enable us to know where are customers are located.

dbo.dimcustomer was renamed to c and dbo.dimgeography renamed to g. (alias)


			//DIM PRODUCTS
I joined two sub category and category because I might be interested in looking at sales per sub category or per  and main category and he wants to look at it in different ways.

ISNULL  means when it is NULL replaced with Outdated.


		//DIM FACT TABLE


LEFT (OrderDateKey, 4) >= YEAR(GETDATE()) -2

So what the query above  means is that the first four numbers in the ORDER DATE KEY column should be Extracted and I was  to looking at two years from the date of extraction.

Data Cleasing nd Transformation (SQL)

To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs and telling a story through the data.
Below are the SQL statements for cleasing and transforming necessary data.
